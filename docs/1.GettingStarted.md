### How to use
#### `.stflow`
To use Flowgger, you first need to define the flow of your application or an endpoint in `.stflow` files. A `.stflow` follows the syntax defined by [text2obj](https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/text2obj) node js library. [Text2Chart](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SoloThought.text2chart) VS code plugin can help you to visualize the flow using flow chart. A flow defined in `.stflow`, is used by Flowgger to replace static log statements with steps id. This helps to reduce the log size drastically.

**Sample flow**
```stflow
FLOW: Binary Search
LOOP searching for target in array
  read low (initial index of array)
  read high (last index of array)
  IF low <= high
    THEN calculate mid ((low + high) / 2)
    IF array[mid] = target
      found target at mid
      END
    ELSE
      FOLLOW update boundaries
  ELSE
    ERR Target not found
    END

FLOW: update boundaries
IF array[mid] < target
  update low to mid + 1
ELSE
  update high to mid - 1
```

Branching (`LOOP`, `IF`, `ELSE`, `ELSE_IF`) and termination steps (`END`, `STOP`) **should not be logged**. Only actions taken within a step should be logged.
```js
flog.info("found target at mid");
```
While logging you have to exclude words "THEN", "ERR". These are used in algorithm for understanding purpose. Additionally, extra info in a logging step has to be avoided. E.g. "read low (initial index of array)" should be logged as below

```js
flog.info("read low");
```

#### Appenders
**Appenders** help Flowgger to write logs to a desire streams. Flowgger provides some basic appenders. You can use log4js library for more appenders.

### Configuration
Path of the `.stflow` and appenders need to be configured. First let's understand how appenders can be created.

- Creating Log4js appenders
```js
import log4js from 'log4js';
import Log4jsAdapter from '@solothought/flowgger/Log4jsAdapter';


log4js.configure({
  appenders: {
    error: { type: 'console' }
  },
  categories: {
    error: { appenders: ['error'], level: 'error' },
    default: { appenders: ['error'], level: 'error' }
  }
});
const log4jsErrAppender = new Log4jsAdapter(log4js.getLogger("error"));
```

- Using Flowgger provided basic appenders
```js
import CsvLayout from '@solothought/flowgger/appenders/CsvLayout';
```

- Creating your own custom appenders
```js
class CustomAppender{
  construct(){
    this.streamData = [];
    this.layout;
  }

  append(logRecord, level){
    if(typeof this.layout === "function"){
      this.streamData.push([level, this.layout(logRecord, level)]);
    }else{
      this.streamData.push([level, this.layout[level](logRecord)]);
    }
  }
}

const flowsAppender = new CustomAppender();
const headAppender = new CustomAppender();
const dataAppender = new CustomAppender();
```

There are four type of logs. Flowgger expects you to define the appenders for each type:

| Log Type | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Flows    | Logs the sequence of steps in a flow once a flow is completed or failed. `info` log level is used for this                                                                                                                                |
| Head     | Acknowledges when a flow starts. Since flows remain in memory until completion, there is a risk of losing flows if the application crashes unexpectedly. Logging the acknowledgment ensures traceability. `trace` log level used for this |
| Data     | `Debug` and `Warn` level logs are categorized as data logs. These allow users to log extra information during a flow                                                                                                                      |
| Error    | `Error` and `Fatal` level logs are categorizes as error logs. You should use this when application takes unexpected path which is not defined in `.stflow`.                                                                               |
Note: If an appender is not defined for a specific type, logging for that type will be skipped. 

**Filters**: Logging is enabled by default for all the appenders. You can configure an appender to log for particular flow or particular type of logs using `notFor` and `onlyFor` properties. Name of the flow must match with the flow name defined in `.stflow`. If filters are not defined, all the flows for all the types would logged.

Configure Flowgger to use appenders for each flow type.
```js
const config = {
    "appenders": [
      {
        handler: flowsAppender,
        layout: lr => { // can be a function or object
          return `${lr.success},${lr.id},${lr.reportTime},${lr.flowName},${lr.steps}`;
        },
        onlyFor: {
          types: ["flows"],
          flows: ["second flow(2)", "first flow"]
        }
      },
      {
        handler: headAppender,
        layout: new CsvLayout(),
        onlyFor: {
          types: ["head"],
          flows: ["second flow(2)", "first flow"]
        }
      },
      {
        handler: dataAppender,
        // layout: logRecord => logRecord, // default
        onlyFor: {
          types: ["data", "error"],
          flows: ["second flow(2)", "first flow"]
        }
      },
      {
        handler: log4jsErrAppender,
        // layout: logRecord => logRecord, // default
        onlyFor: {
          types: ["error"],
          flows: ["second flow(1)"]
        }
      }
    ],
    flow: {
      source: path.resolve("./tests/flows"),
      // maxIdleTime: 200, // time difference between two consecutive steps
    }
};
```

### Integration

This is the sample of how you can integrate Flowgger to your code
```js
import Flowgger from '@solothought/flowgger';

 //flowgger should be created once and on application level
const flowgger = new Flowgger(config)

// Each endpoint must use Flowgger instance to get a logger instance using 'init' before stating logging
// Flow name passed in 'init' must match to one flow defined in 'stflow' files.
const binFlow = flowgger.init("Binary Search");

// All consecutive code should use non-branching, non-leaving steps from the flow
// using 'info' method
binFlow.info("read low");

//order of the steps in code is most important
binFlow.info("read high");

//You can log additional data using 'debug', 'error', 'warn' methods
binFlow.debug("values", {low: lowVal, high: highVal});

// It is recommended to call 'end' when the flow ends expectedly or divert to unexpected path
binFlow.error("NULL POINTER EXCEPTION", e.stackTrace())
binFlow.end()
```
