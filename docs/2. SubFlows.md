# Subflows

A subflow can be an independent flow that can invoked by other flows. Eg.

```flow
FLOW: Binary Search
LOOP searching for target in array
  read low (initial index of array)
  read high (last index of array)
  IF low <= high
    THEN calculate mid ((low + high) / 2)
    IF array[mid] = target
      found target at mid
      END
    ELSE
      FOLLOW update boundaries
  ELSE
    ERR Target not found
    END

FLOW: update boundaries
IF array[mid] < target
  update low to mid + 1
ELSE
  update high to mid - 1
```
Since subflows are expected to be completed before parent flows. You can find them in logs before the entry for parent flow. Flowgger pass parent flow id and parent step id to trace the path comfortably.

**Head logs**

```
{  id, flowName, version, reportTime, parentFlowId, parentStepId }
```

**Flow logs**
```
{ success, flowName, id, version, reportTime, steps, errMsg, parentFlowId, parentStepId }
```
