# How to Use

Create the object of Flowgger once. And use it to get the logger everytime you start a flow

```js
const flowgger = new Flowgger(config)
//..
const flow = flowgger.init("first flow");

flow.info("a step defined for a flow in .stflow");
flow.info("another step");

flow.error("log an error in logs with no impact on the flow")
flow.debug(requestId) //Log additional info

flow.end(); //optional but helpful to end the flow gracefully
```

## Play and Pause

Flowgger allow a user to pass an extra key to debug statements.
```
flow.debug(additionalInfo, "extra")
```

You can play/pause debug logs based on the key.
```
flogger.pause({
  keys: ["extra"]
})

//..
flogger.play({
  keys: ["extra"]
})
```

In addition of this, you can pause the logs for specific flow or level (debug, warn);

```
flogger.pause({
  levels: ["debug","warn"],
  flows: ["flowname(version)", ""],
  keys: ["keys"]
})
```
