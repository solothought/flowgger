# How to Use

Create the object of Flowgger once. And use it to get the logger everytime you start a flow

```js
const flowgger = new Flowgger(config)
//..
const flow = flowgger.init("first flow"); // 0.0.1 is default version

flow.info("a step defined for a flow in .stflow");
flow.info("another step");

flow.error("log an error in logs with no impact on the flow")
flow.debug(requestId) //Log additional info

flow.end(); //optional but helpful to end the flow gracefully
```

## Play and Pause

Flowgger allows a user to pass an extra key to a log statements (warn, error, debug). By default, all the logs with key provided are paused. If you plays these logs and restart the  application, they'll be in initial state i.e. paused.

```
flow.debug(additionalInfo, data, "v1.2")
```

You can play/pause debug logs based on the key.
```
flogger.play({
  keys: ["v1.2","v1.2.1"]
})

//..
flogger.pause({
  keys: ["v1.2.1"]
})

```

In addition of this, you can pause the logs for specific flow or level (debug, warn);

```
flogger.pause({
  type: ["data","error"], //data: debug, warn
  flows: ["flowname(version)", ""],
  keys: ["keys"]
})
```

Note that: 'keys' takes priority.
