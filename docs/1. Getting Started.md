### Flowgger Documentation

**Introduction**

Flowgger is a logging application developed in pure JavaScript. Unlike traditional logging tools, Flowgger requires users to define the flow of their code in advance using `.stflow` files. It matches logging statements against this predefined flow and logs only the index of each statement. This eliminates the need to sift through entire log files to locate logs related to a single flow. Instead, Flowgger collects the entire sequence of steps in a flow and passes them to an appender for logging. Additionally, Flowgger notifies users if a flow is successfully completed (ended).

> You can use [Text2Chart](https://solothought.com/text2chart/) to visualize `.stflow` files.

This innovative approach benefits users in two significant ways:
1. **Reduced Log Size:** Logs are minimal, resulting in faster logging and reduced storage requirements.
2. **Efficient Debugging:** Debugging time is drastically reduced from days to minutes.

**Types of Logs**

Flowgger generates four types of logs:

1. **Flows:**
   - Logs the sequence of steps in a flow once a flow is completed or failed.

2. **Head:**
   - Acknowledges when a flow starts. Since flows remain in memory until completion, there is a risk of losing flows if the application crashes unexpectedly. Logging the acknowledgment ensures traceability.

3. **Error:**
   - Errors are logged in the following scenarios:
     - When users manually log errors, similar to other logging frameworks.
     - When users report a step not present in the predefined path or miss reporting the expected next step.
     - When users log with a fatal log level.

4. **Data:**
   - `Debug` and `Warn` level logs are categorized as data logs. These allow users to log extra information during a flow, irrespective of the predefined flow.

**Dynamic Logging**

Flowgger supports dynamic logging, enabling users to:
- Enable or disable specific log statements or logs for particular flows at runtime without redeploying the application.
- Send additional logs to separate aggregators for independent analysis.
- Toggle logging for specific flows, environments, or groups of debug statements dynamically.

**Use Cases**

Flowgger’s unique capabilities open up diverse use cases, such as:

1. **Simplifying Debugging in Complex Implementations:**
   - For complex applications, it can be challenging to identify the path the application takes for a specific input. Flowgger allows users to trace the exact path taken without needing to run the application in debug mode.

2. **Minimizing Log Overhead:**
   - By drastically reducing log size, Flowgger ensures logs are concise and actionable.

3. **Error Identification and Resolution:**
   - Users can quickly identify and address errors related to unexpected steps or paths.

**Additional Features**

- **Efficient Logging:** Flowgger minimizes unnecessary data logging while maintaining the ability to debug unexpected issues by enabling dynamic logs.
- **Fast and Scalable:** Less data means faster logging, which is crucial for high-performance applications.
- **Customizable:** Users can adapt Flowgger’s behavior to suit specific use cases or environments.
